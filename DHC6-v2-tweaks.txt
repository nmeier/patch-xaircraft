RWDesign's DHC6 Twin Otter Tweaks
Aircraft Version: 2.0.2
Tweak Version: 2.0.2.6

These twin otter tweaks are for the 2.0.2 DHC Twin Otter by RWDesign

Tweaks:
2.0.2.1
* Make autopilot ALT button behave as altitude arm allowing to intercept set altitude in IAS mode (DHC6_cockpit.obj)
* Add autopilot button lighting as per oeverhead light dial (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Allow autopilot altitude changes via x-plane commands refs/keybindings sim/autopilot/altitude_down|up (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Allow ADF changes via x-plane commands refs/keybindings sim/radios/actv_adf1_hundreds|tens|ones|ones_tens_down|up (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Add beta prop range (DHC6.acf)
* Make throttle levers move visually through reverse/BETA/alpha (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Fix developer log filling with "[SASL ERROR] can't load component part_aa" when no livery selected (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Fix overhead Deicer Boots Inner/Out Wing switch (DHC6_cockpit.obj)
* Switch to x-plane's new PT6 "Free N2 Turobrop" model, tweak Ng/Np speeds, change gauges to use N1/2_percent, tune starter(DHC6.acf & DHC6_cockpit.obj)
* Fix bus tie switch as "normal" cross_tie should be 1, 0 otherwise
* Disable auto update so tweaks are not overridden
2.0.2.2
* Fix lights and igniters to work if on  external power (Custom Avionics\master\master.lua)
* Fix MANUAL IGNITION meaning always on, NORMAL meaning auto w/starter, ENG IGNITER are three state (L/Both/R) but INOP
* Fix forward fuelpump being silent
* Fix overhead flight compartment switch toggle power to cabin lights
2.0.2.3
* Apply previous fixes to all Twin Otter models (floats, short, tundra)
* Tune floats for better water handling
* Make autopilot ALT button set current indicated altitude if IAS mode is not engaged yet (allowing for hold here)
2.0.2.4
* Add invisible water rudder (<25knots, effective >5kt, not in real life) improving taxi with X-Plane's limitations on water
* Move anchor under plane to control mooring location better
* Zero out parking brakes over 25kt to avoid water landing with 'hook extended' (anchor goes down with parking_brake_ratio=0.05)
2.0.2.5
* Rework autopilot buttons (light level, battery status)
* Add lighting to altitude selector, Nav, OBS, CRS knobs
* Fix texture of panel for spelling on 3 gauges (PRECENT)
* Fix texture of overhead ignitor switch (ON1,BOTH,ON2) - inop switch since 2.0.2.2 selection of igniter 1/2 per engine
* Rework autopilot ALT button to allow to go into Altitude Arm, Hold, and out of hold successfully
* Recharge battery on external power (instant recharge allows startup of engines)
2.0.2.6
* Make AP switch indicate correctly on cmd servos_toggle
* Tweak behavior when setting up HDG/IAS/ALT before takeoff, servos stay off, IAS speed is set when servos engaged

Installation:

* Stop X-Plane

* Make sure to have runÂ XPLANEHOME\Aircraft\Extra Aircraft\DHC6-300 Twin Otter V2\STMAClient.exe once to make sure you're on version 2.0.2

* Make a backup of XPLANEHOME\Aircraft\Extra Aircraft\DHC6-300 Twin Otter V2 into a folder outside of X-Plane

* Download and install Python 2.7.x (64bit or applicable platform, on windows install into C:\Python27)

* Download and unzip tweakotter-2.0.2.*.zip into the twin otter folder XPLANEHOME\Aircraft\Extra Aircraft\DHC6-300 Twin Otter V2

* Verify you see additional files
		DHC6-300 Twin Otter V2.0.2.*.diff
		patch.py
		tweak-dhc6.py

* Open a command line, cd into the twin otter folder and run

    python -m pip install Pillow
		"c:\Python27\python.exe" tweak-dhc6.py

	NOTE: Any updates to tweaks will reverted the previous patch - for that to work make sure to keep
	the previous downloaded and applied V2.0.2.*.diff file in the twin otter folder!

* Notice output
		Reverting previous tweaks to DHC6 (2.0.2.a)
		...
		Applying latest tweaks to DHC6 (2.0.2.b)
		successfully patched 1/n:        DHC6.acf
		successfully patched 2/n:        DHC6_cockpit.obj
		successfully patched ..
		successfully patched n/n:        plugins/STMA_AutoUpdate/AutoUpdate_settings.txt

	NOTE: If you notice any errors in this process then either you were not patching the original 2.0.2 Twin Otter, or any
	modifications to it are incompatible with patching the appropriate files. Send output to author in X-Plane forum.

* Start X-Plane

FAQ

Q: Everything failed, get me out of here!
A: Restore from the backup folder you've created

Q: I can't control the beta/reverse range!
A: Use X-Plane's beta/reverse toggle keys or try out https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/57160-pi_rba_throttlepy

Q: My checklist says I have to turn the igniters on!
A: As per what I could find in real world documentation and online discussions the pilot doesn't have to turn on igniters.
   They turn on with the starter, the MANUAL/NORMAL switch simply allows to turn on permanently when in danger of blow-out
	 and left/right igniters allow to choose between two igniters per engine - normal is BOTH.

Q: The starter turns the engine but even with mixture full foward the engine does not ignite!
A: Check fuel pump switches - currently AFT/FWD are required for left and right engine respectively.

Q: My engine temp goes into red after turning the starter on.
A: You're adding fuel too early, wait for minimum 12% N1.

Q: How do I apply a new version of the path?
A: Grab the latest and follow the instructions. If you have a previous patch applied any new changes will be applied.
